<h1>You're headed to learn about our Academics</h1>
<p>The Industry Integrated Engineering Program in Mechanical Engineering is for Diploma Mechanical Engineering Students is 3 years full time program offered by Chitkara University at Rajpura, Punjab.
There are Four (4) academic semesters and last Two (2) semesters are solely dedicated to Intensive Industry Internship Program (IIIP) with our partner industries & system integrators.
Academic framework lays strong emphasize on learning through hands on. Courses in foundation, technology and advanced technology feature state of the art lab infrastructure enable this without any hassles.
Subjects carry full industry focus to ensure student stays connected with real working atmosphere all the time. This is further complimented by frequent industry visits and on the job short projects.
To get further ahead, you will work on latest cutting edge lab, which not only simulates the real-time, but also makes you cope up with field situations.
